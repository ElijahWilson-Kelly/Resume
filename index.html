        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a curious, enthusiastic and motivated individual who values
          learning new ideas, processes and skills. I am both patient and
          tenacious, able to apply consistency and creativity to my work, with
          a willingness to approach situations with a mix of experience and an
          openness to innovation. I embrace new challenges as well as being
          adept at identifying and implementing solutions to existing
          problems. I have a diverse range of hobbies and interests which I
          believe provides me with access to a considered and unique
          perspective on assignments. I enjoy working in a team environment
          and appreciate the value of learning from, and providing support to,
          others. I'm also equally comfortable working autonomously with
          minimal supervision.

          <h3>Work</h3>
        </div>
        <h4>Shankara NZ</h4>
        <p class="year">2016 - Present (Part-Time)</p>
        <p class="role">Producer / Perfomer</p>
        <p>
          One of my primary passions is music, and I produce and perform it
          for an electronic music group called Shankara NZ. This project has
          provided me with the opportunity to play at venues and festivals
          around New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and Europe. It has
          been an excellent way to express my creativity and experiment with
          what is possible to produce with the help of computers and computer
          software. I use a DAW (DIGITAL AUDIO WORKSTATION) and various
          synthesisers (both digital and analogue); working with technology
          has always been an integral and valuable component of my creative
          process.

        <h4>Bohemian Bakery</h4>
        <p class="role">Head Barista</p>
        <p class="year">2020-2022</p>
        <p>
          In this role, it was my responsibility to train and supervise staff
          on relevant coffee-making equipment. I was required to upskill new
          team members quickly and efficiently to ensure uniformity in product
          and service across all branches of the business. By ensuring a high
          and consistent standard of quality, I played a key role in helping
          the business expand; Bohemian Bakery was able to add an extra store
          during my time with the company.
